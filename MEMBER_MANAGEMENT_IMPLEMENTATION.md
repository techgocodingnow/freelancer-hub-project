## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the member management feature for the Freelancer Hub application. This feature allows users with admin, owner, or project manager roles to invite members to join their organization or specific projects.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Implementation

#### Database Schema
- **New Table: `invitations`**
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `email`: Email address of the invitee
  - `token`: Unique 64-character token for invitation validation
  - `tenant_id`: Organization the user is invited to
  - `role_id`: Role to be assigned upon acceptance
  - `project_id`: Optional project assignment
  - `invited_by`: User who created the invitation
  - `status`: Enum (pending, accepted, expired, cancelled)
  - `expires_at`: Expiration timestamp (default: 7 days)
  - `accepted_at`: Timestamp when invitation was accepted
  - `accepted_by`: User who accepted the invitation
  - Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

#### Models
- **`Invitation` Model** (`freelancer-hub-backend/app/models/invitation.ts`)

- **`AuthController`** (Modified: `freelancer-hub-backend/app/controllers/auth.ts`)
  - Updated `register()` method to support invitation-based registration
  - Validates invitation token
  - Auto-assigns user to tenant and project based on invitation

#### Services
- **`EmailService`** (Extended: `freelancer-hub-backend/app/services/email_service.ts`)
  - `sendInvitationEmail()`: Send invitation email with registration link
  - `generateInvitationEmailHTML()`: Create styled HTML email template

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Inviting a New Member
1. Admin/Owner clicks "Invite Member" button on Users page
2. Modal opens with email and role selection
3. Admin enters email and selects role
4. System creates invitation and sends email
5. Invitation appears in "Pending Invitations" section
6. Admin can resend or cancel invitation

### Flow 2: Accepting an Invitation
1. User receives invitation email with registration link
2. User clicks link and is directed to `/register/invitation/:token`
3. System validates token and displays invitation details
4. User sees organization name, role, and project (if applicable)
5. User enters full name and password
6. System creates account and assigns to organization/project
7. User is automatically logged in and redirected to tenant dashboard

### Flow 3: Managing Invitations
1. Admin views pending invitations on Users page
2. Can resend invitation (extends expiration by 7 days)
3. Can cancel invitation (prevents acceptance)
4. Expired invitations are automatically marked

## Security Features

### Role-Based Access Control
- Only admin and owner roles can create, resend, or cancel invitations
- Invitation endpoints are protected by authentication middleware
- Tenant context is enforced for all invitation operations

### Token Security
- 64-character random tokens generated using crypto.randomBytes
- Tokens are unique and indexed for fast lookup
- Tokens expire after 7 days (configurable)

### Validation
- Email format validation
- Duplicate invitation prevention
- Existing user detection
- Token expiration checking
- Email matching on registration

## Email Template
The invitation email includes:
- Organization name
- Inviter's name
- Assigned role
- Project name (if applicable)
- Expiration date
- Registration link with token
- Professional HTML styling

## Database Migrations
Run the following command to create the invitations table:
```bash
cd freelancer-hub-backend
node ace migration:run
```

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Create invitation as admin/owner
- [ ] Attempt to create invitation as member (should fail)

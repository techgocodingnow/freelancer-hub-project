# Timesheets Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive Timesheets feature has been successfully implemented for the Freelancer Hub application, inspired by Hubstaff's timesheet functionality. This feature allows users to create, manage, submit, and approve weekly timesheets with detailed time entry tracking.

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Backend Implementation

#### Database Schema (Migrations)

**Created 3 migration files:**

1. **`1759270000001_create_timesheets_table.ts`**

   - Main timesheets table with fields:
     - `user_id`, `tenant_id` (foreign keys)
     - `week_start_date`, `week_end_date` (date range)
     - `status` (enum: draft, submitted, pending_approval, approved, rejected)
     - `total_hours`, `billable_hours`, `regular_hours`, `overtime_hours`
     - `submitted_at`, `approved_at`, `rejected_at`
     - `approver_id`, `rejection_reason`
   - Unique constraint: one timesheet per user per week
   - Comprehensive indexes for performance

2. **`1759270000002_create_timesheet_approvals_table.ts`**

   - Audit trail for approval actions
   - Fields: `timesheet_id`, `approver_id`, `action`, `reason`, `created_at`
   - Action enum: approved, rejected, reopened

3. **`1759270000003_extend_time_entries_for_timesheets.ts`**
   - Extended existing `time_entries` table
   - Added `timesheet_id` foreign key (nullable, SET NULL on delete)
   - Added `notes` field for time entry notes

**Migration Status:** ✅ Successfully run and applied to database

#### Models

**Created/Updated 3 Lucid models:**

1. **`Timesheet.ts`** - Main timesheet model

   - Relationships: `@belongsTo` User, Tenant, Approver; `@hasMany` TimeEntry, TimesheetApproval
   - Helper methods:
     - `canBeSubmitted()`, `canBeApproved()`, `canBeRejected()`, `canBeReopened()`, `isEditable()`
     - `submit()`, `approve(approverId)`, `reject(approverId, reason)`, `reopen(approverId)`
     - `calculateHours()` - calculates total, billable, regular, and overtime hours

2. **`TimesheetApproval.ts`** - Approval audit trail model

   - Relationships: `@belongsTo` Timesheet, Approver

3. **`TimeEntry.ts`** (Updated)
   - Added `timesheetId` field and `@belongsTo` Timesheet relationship
   - Added `notes` field

#### Validators

**Created `timesheets.ts` with 5 validators:**

- `createTimesheetValidator` - validates weekStartDate, weekEndDate
- `submitTimesheetValidator` - validates optional notes
- `approveTimesheetValidator` - validates optional notes
- `rejectTimesheetValidator` - validates reason (10-500 chars required)
- `updateTimesheetValidator` - validates array of time entries

#### Controller

**Created `TimesheetsController.ts` with 10 endpoints:**

1. **`index()`** - List timesheets with pagination, filtering, sorting

   - Filters: status, user_id, week_start_date, week_end_date
   - Authorization: Non-admins see only their own timesheets
   - Response format: `{ data: [...], meta: { total, perPage, currentPage, lastPage } }`

2. **`show()`** - Get single timesheet with all time entries

   - Preloads: user, approver, timeEntries (with task and project)
   - Authorization: Users can only view their own timesheets (unless admin)

3. **`store()`** - Create new timesheet

   - Validates week dates
   - Checks for existing timesheet for the same week
   - Auto-links existing time entries for the week
   - Calculates hours automatically

4. **`update()`** - Update timesheet time entries

   - Only editable in draft status
   - Updates existing entries or creates new ones
   - Recalculates hours after update

5. **`submit()`** - Submit timesheet for approval

   - Changes status from draft to submitted
   - Records submission timestamp

6. **`approve()`** - Approve timesheet (admin/owner only)

   - Changes status to approved
   - Records approver and approval timestamp
   - Creates approval audit record

7. **`reject()`** - Reject timesheet (admin/owner only)

   - Changes status to rejected
   - Records rejection reason and timestamp
   - Creates approval audit record

8. **`reopen()`** - Reopen approved/rejected timesheet (admin/owner only)

   - Changes status back to draft
   - Creates approval audit record

9. **`destroy()`** - Delete timesheet

   - Only draft timesheets can be deleted
   - Unlinks time entries before deletion

10. **`summary()`** - Get timesheet statistics
    - Returns counts by status and total hours
    - Filters: user_id, start_date, end_date

#### Routes

**Added to `start/routes.ts`:**

```typescript
router.get("/timesheets", [TimesheetsController, "index"]);
router.get("/timesheets/summary", [TimesheetsController, "summary"]);
router.get("/timesheets/:id", [TimesheetsController, "show"]);
router.post("/timesheets", [TimesheetsController, "store"]);
router.put("/timesheets/:id", [TimesheetsController, "update"]);
router.patch("/timesheets/:id", [TimesheetsController, "update"]);
router.delete("/timesheets/:id", [TimesheetsController, "destroy"]);
router.post("/timesheets/:id/submit", [TimesheetsController, "submit"]);
router.post("/timesheets/:id/approve", [TimesheetsController, "approve"]);
router.post("/timesheets/:id/reject", [TimesheetsController, "reject"]);
router.post("/timesheets/:id/reopen", [TimesheetsController, "reopen"]);
```

All routes are tenant-scoped and require authentication.

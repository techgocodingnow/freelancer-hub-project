## Known Issues

### Pre-existing TypeScript Errors
The following TypeScript errors exist in the codebase but are not related to Phase 1:

1. **src/pages/projects/create.tsx:104** - InputNumber parser type
2. **src/pages/projects/edit.tsx:136** - InputNumber parser type
3. **src/pages/register/index.tsx:301** - Type conversion
4. **src/pages/users/list.tsx:110** - Unused variable

These errors were present before Phase 1 implementation and should be addressed separately.

### Phase 1 Limitations
1. **TaskFilters Component** - Created but not yet integrated into task list page

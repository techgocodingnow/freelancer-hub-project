## Enhanced Kanban Board üéØ

### What is it?
The Kanban Board has been improved with better visual feedback, collapsible columns, and optional work-in-progress (WIP) limits.

### How to Access
1. Navigate to any project's task list
2. Click the **"Kanban View"** button in the top right
3. Or go directly to: `/tenants/[your-tenant]/projects/[project-id]/tasks/kanban`

### New Features

#### Task Count Badges
Each column header now shows a badge with the number of tasks in that column. This helps you see at a glance how work is distributed.

#### Collapse/Expand Columns
1. Click the **up/down arrow** button in any column header
2. The column will collapse, hiding all tasks
3. A message shows how many tasks are hidden
4. Click the button again to expand the column

**Why use this?**
- Focus on specific columns by collapsing others
- Reduce visual clutter
- Make more room for the columns you're working on

#### Drop Zone Highlighting
When you drag a task:
- The column you're hovering over will **highlight**
- The border becomes **dashed**
- The background color changes slightly
- The column expands to show you can drop there

This makes it crystal clear where your task will land!

#### WIP Limits (Optional)
If your team has configured WIP limits:
- Each column shows its limit (e.g., "Limit: 5")
- The badge turns **red** when you exceed the limit
- This is a visual reminder to finish work before starting new tasks

**Note:** WIP limits are soft limits - you can still add tasks, but you'll see a warning.

### How to Use

#### Moving Tasks
1. **Click and hold** on a task card
2. **Drag** it to a different column
3. **Drop** it in the new column
4. The task's status will automatically update

#### Filtering Tasks
Use the filters at the top to:
- Filter by assignee
- Filter by priority

#### Creating New Tasks
Click the **"New Task"** button in the top right.

### Tips
- Collapse columns you're not actively working on
- Watch for red WIP limit warnings - they indicate you might be taking on too much at once
- Use the visual drop zone feedback to ensure you're dropping tasks in the right column
- Combine filters to focus on specific work (e.g., "High priority tasks assigned to me")

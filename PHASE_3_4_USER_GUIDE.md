## Tips & Tricks

### Productivity Boosters

**Combine Filters**
- Use multiple filters together for precise results
- Example: High priority + Due this week + Assigned to me

**Create View Templates**
- Save views for common scenarios:
  - "Today's Tasks" - Due today, assigned to me
  - "Team Review" - Status: Review, all assignees
  - "Overdue" - Due date before today
  - "Quick Wins" - Low estimated hours, high priority

**Mobile Workflow**
- Use swipe actions for quick task management
- Bottom nav for fast view switching
- FAB for instant task creation

**Keyboard Shortcuts** (Desktop)
- `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) - Open command palette
- `Escape` - Close panels
- `Tab` - Navigate between fields

### Best Practices

**Organize with Favorites**
- Star tasks you're actively working on
- Review and un-star completed tasks weekly
- Keep favorites list under 10 for focus

**Use Saved Views Strategically**
- Create views for different contexts (work modes)
- Set your most common view as default
- Favorite your top 3-5 views

**Filter Efficiently**
- Start broad, then narrow down
- Save frequently-used filter combinations
- Use search for quick lookups

**Mobile Optimization**
- Swipe left to complete tasks quickly
- Use bottom nav instead of scrolling to top
- FAB is faster than menu navigation

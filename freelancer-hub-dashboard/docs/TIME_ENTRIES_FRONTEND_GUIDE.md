# Time Entries Frontend Implementation Guide

## Overview

The frontend has been updated to use the new unified global `/time-entries` endpoint for comprehensive time entry management. This provides a dedicated interface for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting time entries across all projects and tasks.

## New Pages

### 1. Time Entries List (`/time-entries`)
**Location**: `src/pages/time-entries/list.tsx`

**Features**:
- **View Modes**: Toggle between daily and weekly views
- **Comprehensive Filtering**:
  - Date range picker
  - Project filter
  - User filter (admin only)
  - Billable/non-billable filter
- **Summary Statistics**:
  - Total hours
  - Billable hours
  - Non-billable hours
  - Entry count
- **Visual Analytics**:
  - Bar chart showing hours by day/week
  - Pie chart showing hours by project
- **Data Table**: Sortable, filterable table with all time entries
- **Actions**: Edit and delete time entries directly from the list
- **Export**: CSV export functionality

**API Integration**:
```typescript
useList({
  resource: "time-entries",
  filters: [
    { field: "view_mode", operator: "eq", value: "daily" },
    { field: "start_date", operator: "eq", value: "2025-01-01" },
    { field: "end_date", operator: "eq", value: "2025-01-31" },
    { field: "project_id", operator: "eq", value: 123 },
    { field: "billable", operator: "eq", value: "true" },
  ],
})
```

**Response Structure**:
```typescript
{
  data: TimeEntry[],
  meta: { total, perPage, currentPage, lastPage },
  summary: {
    totalHours: number,
    billableHours: number,
    nonBillableHours: number,
    entryCount: number
  },
  breakdown: {
    byProject: [{ projectId, projectName, totalHours }],
    byTime: [{ period, totalHours, billableHours }]
  }
}
```

### 2. Create Time Entry (`/time-entries/create`)
**Location**: `src/pages/time-entries/create.tsx`

**Features**:
- Project selection dropdown
- Task selection dropdown (filtered by selected project)
- Date picker
- Start time and end time pickers
- Description field (required)
- Notes field (optional)
- Billable toggle switch
- Automatic duration calculation
- Validation for end time > start time

**API Integration**:
```typescript
useCreate({
  resource: "time-entries",
  values: {
    project_id: 123,
    task_id: 456,
    date: "2025-01-15",
    start_time: "2025-01-15T09:00:00Z",
    end_time: "2025-01-15T17:00:00Z",
    description: "Worked on feature X",
    notes: "Additional context",
    billable: true
  }
})
```

### 3. Edit Time Entry (`/time-entries/:id/edit`)
**Location**: `src/pages/time-entries/edit.tsx`

**Features**:
- Same form as create page
- Pre-populated with existing time entry data
- All fields editable
- Validation for end time > start time

**API Integration**:
```typescript
useUpdate({
  resource: "time-entries",
  id: 789,
  values: {
    project_id: 123,
    task_id: 456,
    date: "2025-01-15",
    start_time: "2025-01-15T09:00:00Z",
    end_time: "2025-01-15T18:00:00Z",
    description: "Updated description",
    notes: "Updated notes",
    billable: true
  }
})
```

## Updated Pages

### Time Activity Report (`/reports/time-activity`)
**Location**: `src/pages/reports/time-activity.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Now uses the global `time-entries` endpoint instead of `reports/time-activity`
- Leverages server-side aggregation for better performance
- Uses `breakdown.byTime` and `breakdown.byProject` from API response
- No longer calculates aggregations client-side

**Before**:
```typescript
useList({ resource: "reports/time-activity" })
// Client-side aggregation
const hoursByDay = timeEntries.reduce(...)
```

**After**:
```typescript
useList({ resource: "time-entries", filters: [...] })
// Server-side aggregation
const hoursByDay = breakdown.byTime
const hoursByProject = breakdown.byProject
```

## Navigation & Routing

### App.tsx Updates
Added new routes:
```typescript
<Route path="time-entries">
  <Route index element={<TimeEntriesList />} />
  <Route path="create" element={<TimeEntryCreate />} />
  <Route path=":id/edit" element={<TimeEntryEdit />} />
</Route>
```

### RefineWithTenant.tsx Updates
Registered new resource:
```typescript
{
  name: "time-entries",
  list: `/tenants/${slug}/time-entries`,
  create: `/tenants/${slug}/time-entries/create`,
  edit: `/tenants/${slug}/time-entries/:id/edit`,
  meta: {
    label: "Time Entries",
    canDelete: true,
    icon: <CheckSquareOutlined />,
  },
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Unified Time Entry Management
- Single dedicated page for all time entry operations
- No longer scattered across task pages and timesheet pages
- Consistent interface for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting

### 2. Enhanced Filtering & Analytics
- Daily vs weekly view toggle
- Multi-dimensional filtering (date, project, user, billable)
- Real-time summary statistics
- Visual charts for better insights

### 3. Improved Workflow
- Quick access to create new time entries
- Inline editing and deletion from list view
- CSV export for external reporting
- Mobile-responsive design

### 4. Better Performance
- Server-side aggregation reduces client-side computation
- Efficient pagination for large datasets
- Optimized API calls with targeted filtering

## Authorization & Security

### Non-Admin Users
- Can only view their own time entries
- User filter is hidden
- Can create, edit, and delete their own entries

### Admin/Owner Users
- Can view all time entries in the tenant
- User filter is visible
- Can edit and delete any time entry
- Full access to all filtering options

## Mobile Responsiveness

All pages are fully responsive:
- **Mobile**: Vertical layout, simplified filters, touch-friendly controls
- **Tablet**: Hybrid layout with collapsible sections
- **Desktop**: Full layout with all features visible

## Integration with Existing Features

### Timer Widget
- Still uses task-scoped endpoints for start/stop operations
- Active timer displayed in floating button
- Seamless integration with time entries list

### Timesheets
- Timesheets remain separate for approval workflows
- Time entries can be viewed independently
- Both features coexist without conflict

### Reports
- Time Activity Report now uses the same endpoint
- Consistent data across all views
- Shared filtering and aggregation logic

## API Endpoints Used

### List Time Entries
```
GET /api/v1/time-entries
Query params: view_mode, start_date, end_date, project_id, user_id, billable
```

### Create Time Entry
```
POST /api/v1/time-entries
Body: { project_id, task_id, date, start_time, end_time, description, notes, billable }
```

### Update Time Entry
```
PUT /api/v1/time-entries/:id
Body: { project_id, task_id, date, start_time, end_time, description, notes, billable }
```

### Delete Time Entry
```
DELETE /api/v1/time-entries/:id
```

## Testing Recommendations

   - Test edit/delete permissions

### Automated Testing
Consider adding:
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for API calls
- E2E tests for complete workflows

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

2. **Templates**: Save time entry templates for recurring tasks
3. **Quick Entry**: Inline creation without navigating to create page
4. **Drag & Drop**: Drag entries to different dates
5. **Calendar View**: Visual calendar interface for time entries
6. **Time Tracking**: Start/stop timer directly from time entries page
7. **Notifications**: Reminders for missing time entries
8. **Approval Integration**: Submit time entries for approval

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Time entries not loading
- **Solution**: Check network tab for API errors, verify authentication

**Issue**: Filters not working
- **Solution**: Check query parameters in network tab, verify backend filtering logic

**Issue**: Charts not rendering
- **Solution**: Verify breakdown data structure, check console for errors

**Issue**: Create/Edit form validation errors
- **Solution**: Check required fields, verify date/time format

**Issue**: Permission denied errors
- **Solution**: Verify user role, check authorization logic

## Conclusion

The new time entries frontend provides a comprehensive, user-friendly interface for managing time entries across all projects and tasks. It leverages the unified backend API for consistent behavior and improved performance, while maintaining mobile responsiveness and proper authorization controls.

**Key Benefits**:
✅ Unified interface for all time entry operations

## Backend Implementation

### New Controller Methods

**File:** `freelancer-hub-backend/app/controllers/reports.ts`

#### 1. `timeActivity()`
- Returns detailed time entries with user, task, and project information
- Supports filtering by user, project, date range, and billable status
- Includes pagination (50 entries per page)
- Calculates summary statistics (total hours, billable hours, non-billable hours, entry count)

#### 2. `dailyTotals()`
- Returns time entries grouped by user and date
- Aggregates daily totals for each user
- Supports filtering by user, project, and date range
- Optimized for weekly grid display

### Routes Added

**File:** `freelancer-hub-backend/start/routes.ts`

```typescript
router.get('/reports/time-activity', [ReportsController, 'timeActivity'])
router.get('/reports/daily-totals', [ReportsController, 'dailyTotals'])
```

---

## Frontend Implementation

### Dependencies Added

- **recharts** (v2.x) - React charting library for data visualization

### Pages Created

1. **`src/pages/reports/time-activity.tsx`** - Time & Activity Report
2. **`src/pages/reports/daily-totals.tsx`** - Daily Totals Report
3. **`src/pages/reports/payments.tsx`** - Payments Report
4. **`src/pages/reports/index.ts`** - Export file

### Routes Added

**File:** `src/App.tsx`

```typescript
<Route path="reports">
  <Route path="time-activity" element={<TimeActivityReport />} />
  <Route path="daily-totals" element={<DailyTotalsReport />} />
  <Route path="payments" element={<PaymentsReport />} />
</Route>
```

### Resource Added

**File:** `src/components/RefineWithTenant.tsx`

```typescript
{
  name: "reports",
  list: `/tenants/${slug}/reports/time-activity`,
  meta: {
    label: "Reports",
    canDelete: false,
  },
}
```

## Responsive Design Patterns

All report pages follow the established responsive design patterns:

### Mobile (< 768px)
- ✅ Vertical layout for filters and controls
- ✅ Full-width buttons and inputs
- ✅ Stacked summary cards (1 column)
- ✅ Charts full-width with reduced height (250px)
- ✅ Tables with horizontal scroll
- ✅ Simple pagination
- ✅ Smaller title (h3)
- ✅ Reduced padding and spacing

### Tablet (768px - 992px)
- ✅ 2-column layout for summary cards
- ✅ Appropriate spacing and gutters
- ✅ Filters adapt to available space

### Desktop (> 992px)
- ✅ Horizontal layout for filters
- ✅ 4-column layout for summary cards
- ✅ Charts with full height (300px)
- ✅ Tables fit without scroll
- ✅ Full pagination with size changer
- ✅ Larger title (h2)
- ✅ Optimal padding and spacing

### Common Patterns Used

```typescript
// Responsive hooks
const isMobile = useIsMobile();
const isTablet = useIsTablet();

// Responsive container
<ResponsiveContainer>
  {/* Content */}
</ResponsiveContainer>

// Responsive header
<div style={{
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: isMobile ? "column" : "row",
  justifyContent: "space-between",
  alignItems: isMobile ? "flex-start" : "center",
}}>
  <Title level={isMobile ? 3 : 2}>Report Title</Title>
  <Button block={isMobile}>Export</Button>
</div>

// Responsive filters
<Space
  direction={isMobile ? "vertical" : "horizontal"}
  style={{ width: "100%", flexWrap: "wrap" }}
>
  {/* Filter components */}
</Space>

// Responsive summary cards
<Row gutter={[16, 16]}>
  <Col xs={24} sm={12} lg={6}>
    <Card><Statistic /></Card>
  </Col>
</Row>

// Responsive charts
<RechartsResponsiveContainer 
  width="100%" 
  height={isMobile ? 250 : 300}
>
  {/* Chart */}
</RechartsResponsiveContainer>

// Responsive tables
<Table
  scroll={{ x: isMobile ? 800 : undefined }}
  pagination={{
    simple: isMobile,
    showSizeChanger: !isMobile,
  }}
/>
```

## Data Visualization

### Charts Implemented

#### Time & Activity Report
1. **Bar Chart - Hours by Day**
   - X-axis: Date
   - Y-axis: Hours
   - Shows daily time distribution

2. **Pie Chart - Hours by Project**
   - Shows percentage distribution of time across projects
   - Color-coded segments
   - Labels with project name and hours

#### Payments Report
1. **Bar Chart - Payments by Team Member**
   - X-axis: User name
   - Y-axis: Amount due ($)
   - Shows payment amounts for each team member

### Chart Library: Recharts

**Why Recharts?**
- React-friendly API
- Responsive by default
- Composable components
- Good TypeScript support
- Active maintenance

## Export Functionality

### CSV Export

All reports include CSV export functionality:

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const exportToCSV = () => {
  const headers = ["Column1", "Column2", ...];
  const rows = data.map(item => [item.field1, item.field2, ...]);
  
  const csvContent = [headers, ...rows]
    .map(row => row.join(","))
    .join("\n");
    
  const blob = new Blob([csvContent], { type: "text/csv" });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const link = document.createElement("a");
  link.href = url;
  link.download = `report-${dayjs().format("YYYY-MM-DD")}.csv`;
  link.click();
  URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
};
```

**Export Includes:**
- All filtered data
- Proper headers
- Formatted values
- Timestamped filename
